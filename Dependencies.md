## MATLAB Toolboxes and Dependencies

This project was developed and tested in MATLAB R2023b using the following toolboxes:

- **Image Processing Toolbox**
  - Used for color space conversion, edge detection, and histogram analysis.
- **Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox**
  - Used for distance metric computations and performance analysis.
- **Additional Toolboxes:**
  - Computer Vision Toolbox
  - Machine Learning ToolBox



No third-party dependencies are required. All scripts can be executed directly within MATLAB once the dataset is configured.
